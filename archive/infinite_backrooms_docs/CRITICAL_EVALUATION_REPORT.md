# Critical Evaluation Report: NASA System 7 Portal

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING**: This repository contains a fundamental project identity crisis. The codebase implements **NASA System 7 Portal** (a React/Node.js NASA API interface with retro System 7 UI) while the extensive documentation describes **Infinite Backrooms** (a Python/Streamlit AI conversation platform). This represents one of the most significant documentation-reality disconnects encountered in modern software development.

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: Complete documentation overhaul and strategic realignment.
