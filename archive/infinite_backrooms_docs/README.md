# Infinite Backrooms Documentation Archive

This folder contains archived documentation for a fictional project called "Infinite Backrooms" that was accidentally created for this NASA System 7 Portal repository.

## Archived Content

The following files were moved here because they describe a completely different project (Python/Streamlit AI platform) that does not exist in this repository:

- `AGENT_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md` - Fictional agent deployment plan for AI conversation platform
- `CRITICAL_EVALUATION_REPORT.md` - Evaluation report for non-existent AI features
- Various phase implementation plans for Infinite Backrooms
- Skills enhancement plans for AI platform development
- Agent directories and coordination guides

## Important Notice

**This documentation is fictional and does not represent the actual NASA System 7 Portal project.**

The actual NASA System 7 Portal is a React/Node.js application that:
- Interacts with NASA and JPL APIs
- Features a System 7 retro UI design
- Uses PostgreSQL for data storage
- Serves as a modern web portal for NASA services

## Current Project Structure

The real project structure is:
```
nasa_system7_portal/
├── client/          # React frontend with System 7 UI
├── server/          # Node.js/Express backend
├── archive/         # This folder (fictional documentation)
└── README.md        # Accurate project documentation
```

## Action Taken

All fictional documentation has been archived on 2025-11-04 to prevent confusion and enable proper development of the actual NASA System 7 Portal.

For accurate information about the real project, please refer to the main README.md file in the repository root.
