    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_monitor = PerformanceMonitor()
        self.component_profiler = ComponentProfiler()
        self.session_analyzer = SessionAnalyzer()

    def analyze_streamlit_performance(self, app_structure):
        # Profile component rendering times
        # Analyze session state efficiency
        # Identify performance bottlenecks
        # Generate optimization recommendations
```

### Real-Time UI Optimizer
```python
class RealTimeUIOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.reactivity_optimizer = ReactivityOptimizer()
        self.component_cacher = ComponentCacher()
        self.ui_profiler = UIProfiler()

    def optimize_realtime_ui(self, ui_components):
        # Optimize component reactivity
        # Implement efficient caching
        # Minimize unnecessary re-renders
        # Improve user experience
```

### Session Management Optimizer
```python
class SessionManagementOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.session_profiler = SessionProfiler()
        .state_optimizer = StateOptimizer()
        .resource_manager = ResourceManager()

    def optimize_session_management(self, session_patterns):
        # Analyze session state usage
        # Optimize state update patterns
        # Implement efficient session isolation
        # Plan resource allocation
