## Implementation Patterns

### Persona Manager Framework
```python
class PersonaManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.persona_registry = PersonaRegistry()
        self.context_manager = ContextManager()
        self.switching_logic = SwitchingLogicEngine()
        self.learning_system = PersonaLearningSystem()

    def manage_persona_system(self, conversation_state):
        # Select optimal persona for context
        # Handle persona switching when needed
        # Coordinate multi-persona conversations
        # Adapt personas based on performance
```

### Dynamic Switching Engine
```python
class DynamicSwitchingEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trigger_analyzer = TriggerAnalyzer()
        self.context_preserver = ContextPreserver()
        self.transition_manager = TransitionManager()

    def execute_persona_switch(self, current_persona, new_context):
        # Analyze switching triggers
        # Preserve relevant context
        # Execute smooth transition
        # Validate new persona behavior
```

### Multi-Persona Coordinator
```python
class MultiPersonaCoordinator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.persona_orchestrator = PersonaOrchestrator()
        self.conversation_manager = ConversationManager()
        self.conflict_resolver = ConflictResolver()

    def coordinate_multi_persona_conversation(self, active_personas, user_input):
        # Assign roles and responsibilities
        # Coordinate turn-taking protocols
        # Handle persona interactions
        # Resolve conflicts and disagreements
```
